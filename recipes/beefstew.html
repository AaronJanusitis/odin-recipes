    <h2>Delicious Beef Stew to warm your bones.</h2>
    <p class="description">This classic French beef stew is the ultimate cold weather comfort food. After a few hours in the oven, the meat becomes meltingly tender and enveloped in a rich wine sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds boneless beef chuck</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 medium yellow onions, cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
        <li>7 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F and set a rack in the lower middle position.</li>
        <li>Pat the beef dry and season with the salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven or heavy soup pot, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering.</li>
        <li>Brown the meat in 3 batches, turning with tongs, for about 5 minutes per batch; add one tablespoon more oil for each batch. </li>
        <li>Add the onions, garlic and balsamic vinegar; cook, stirring with a wooden spoon and scraping the brown bits from bottom of the pan, for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato paste and cook for a minute more. Add the beef with its juices back to the pan and sprinkle with the flour.</li>
        <li>Stir with wooden spoon until the flour is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the wine, beef broth, water, bay leaf, thyme, and sugar. Stir with a wooden spoon to loosen any brown bits from the bottom of the pan and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a lid, transfer to the preheated oven, and braise for 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
